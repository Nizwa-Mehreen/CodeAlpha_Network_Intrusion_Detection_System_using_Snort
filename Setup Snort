Step 1: Update and upgrade the existing packages
	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

Step 2: Install snort supporting libraries and tools
	sudo apt install libdumbnet-dev
	sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev

Step 3: Install DAQ for packet I/O from snort official website and extract it
	wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/daq-2.0.7.tar.gz
	tar -xzvf daq-2.0.7.tar.gz

Step 4: Install flex and bison
	sudo apt install flex bison
To check their versions,
	flex --version
	bison --version

Step 5: Configure DAQ and Install make
	cd daq-2.0.7
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	
Step 6: Download and extract snort from official website
	cd ..
	wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/snort-2.9.20.tar.gz
	tar -xzvf snort-2.9.20.tar.gz
	cd snort-2.9.20
	
Step 7: Check and Install needed Dependencies
	sudo apt install luajit libluajit-5.1-dev
	sudo apt install libssl-dev
	find /usr -name x509.h
	find /usr -name libssl.so
	sudo apt install libtirpc-dev
	dpkg -L libtirpc-dev | grep rpc.h
	sudo ln -s /usr/include/tirpc /usr/include/rpc
	./configure --enable-sourcefire

	cd /home/kali/snort-2.9.20
	make clean
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	
	export CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/tirpc"
	export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include/tirpc"
	
Step 8: Create New Directories for Snort Rules and Log Files
	sudo mkdir /etc/snort
	sudo mkdir /etc/snort/rules
	sudo mkdir /etc/snort/preproc_rules
	sudo mkdir /var/log/snort
	sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules
	
Step 9: Extract Snort Rules and Configure 'snort.conf' file
	sudo tar -xvzf /home/kali/Downloads/community-rules.tar.gz -C /etc/snort/rules/
	sudo cp /etc/snort/rules/community-rules/snort.conf /etc/snort/snort.conf
	sudo cp -r /home/kali/snort-2.9.20/preproc_rules /etc/snort/preproc_rules
	ls -l /etc/snort/preproc_rules/
	sudo mousepad /etc/snort/snort.conf (To open the 'snort.conf' file, can also use 'vim', 'cat', 'nano' instead of 'mousepad')

Change 'var RULE_PATH /.../rules' to 'var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules' (Path to the folder where Rules are present)
Change 'var SO_RULE_PATH /.../dynamicrules' to 'var SO_RULE_PATH /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules' (Comment the line by '# var...' if not using dynamic rules)
Change to 'var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules/preproc_rules' (Patht to the folder preproc_rules)
Add the line 'var SID_MSG_MAP_PATH /etc/snort/sid-msg.map'

Step 10: Create files 'classification.config', 'reference.config' and add contents
	sudo mousepad /etc/snort/classification.config

# This file defines classifications for Snort alerts.
# It assigns a name, description, and priority for each classification.

config classification: not-suspicious,Not Suspicious Traffic,3
config classification: suspicious-traffic,Suspicious Traffic,2
config classification: unknown,Unknown Traffic,1
config classification: attempted-admin,Attempted Administrator Privilege Gain,1
config classification: attempted-user,Attempted User Privilege Gain,1
config classification: shellcode-detect,Executable Code was Detected,1
config classification: trojan-activity,A Network Trojan was Detected,1
config classification: misc-activity,Miscellaneous Activity,3
config classification: misc-attack,Miscellaneous Attack,2
config classification: icmp-event,Generic ICMP event,3
config classification: bad-unknown,Potentially Bad Traffic,2
config classification: tcp-connection,Generic TCP event,4
config classification: attempted-recon,Attempted Information Leak,2
config classification: successful-recon-limited,Information Leak,2
config classification: successful-recon-largescale,Large Scale Information Leak,2
config classification: denial-of-service,Denial of Service Attack,2
config classification: non-standard-protocol,Detection of a Non-Standard Protocol or Event,2
config classification: protocol-command-decode,Generic Protocol Command Decode,3
config classification: web-application-activity,access to a potentially vulnerable web application,2
config classification: web-application-attack,Web Application Attack,1
config classification: exploit-attempt,Attempted Exploit,1

	sudo chmod 644 /etc/snort/classification.config
	sudo nano /etc/snort/reference.config

# This file defines references for Snort alerts.
# It links alert messages to external sources like CVE or Bugtraq.

config reference: bugtraq http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/
config reference: cve http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=
config reference: arachNIDS http://www.whitehats.com/info/IDS
config reference: mcafee http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_
config reference: url http://

	sudo chmod 644 /etc/snort/reference.config

Step 11: Create your own rules
	sudo mousepad /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

Eg: alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Packet Detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
	
	sudo chmod 644 /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

Step 12: Comment the rules which aren't being used in 'snort.conf'

Step 13: If using blacklist and whitelist for the IP addresses, add its path below 'var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules/preproc_rules'

Step 14: Make sure the path to the rules you are using is in 'snort.conf' file
