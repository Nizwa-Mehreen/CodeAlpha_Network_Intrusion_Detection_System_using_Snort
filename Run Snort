1. Test Run for Snort Configuration:
	sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i  network_interface_name
Here '/etc/snort/snort.conf' is the path to 'snort.conf' file

2. To Run Snort in Passive mode:
	snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i network_interface_name

3. To Run Snort in IDS mode and monitor your Network Traffic in Real-Time:
	sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i network_interface_name

    -A console: Shows alerts in the console.
    -q: Quiet mode, minimizing output to just alerts.
    -i network_interface_name: Specifies the network interface to monitor.
    
if you want to check for the errors or warnings, remove -q

4. To Run in Daemon mode (in Background)
	snort -D -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

5. To Log Alert to a file:
	snort -l /var/log/snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i network_interface_name
